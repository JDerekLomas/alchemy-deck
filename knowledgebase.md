## Stages

**Nigredo** (Blackening)
The first stage: death, putrefaction, decomposition. Ravens circle a black sun. Matter darkens in the vessel as the old form dies. Confronting shadow, the dark night before dawn.
> "I am black, white, yellow, and red." —Maier, *Atalanta Fugiens* (1618), p. 150

**Albedo** (Whitening)
The second stage: purification, washing, lunar clarity. A white dove emerges from darkness. The blackened matter is cleansed to silver-white. Emotional purification, seeing clearly.
> "Water washes and purifies all imperfect things which are not fixed." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light* (1628), p. 150

**Citrinitas** (Yellowing)
The third stage: solar dawn, awakening wisdom. Golden light breaks over the horizon. The white matter yellows as consciousness stirs. First glimpse of illumination.
> "On the high summit of the mountain stands the vulture constantly crying: I am white and black, yellow and red." —Maier, *Atalanta Fugiens*, Emblem XLIII

**Rubedo** (Reddening)
The fourth stage: completion, the sacred marriage. Phoenix rises from flames. Sun and moon unite. The red stone is born. Wholeness, integration, the work complete.
> "The fixed becomes volatile; the volatile, fixed; and a new World is established." —Khunrath, *Amphitheater* (1609), p. 306

## Operations

**Calcination**
Burning away impurities. Fierce flames reduce matter to white ash in a crucible. The ego's shell cracks open. Letting go of attachments through fire.
> "All impurities and pollutions of things are purified by fire." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light*, p. 150

**Dissolution**
Breaking down in water. Ash dissolves into solution. Rigid structures melt, emotions flow freely. Surrendering control, allowing feelings to emerge.
> "Water joins together everything that is dissolved." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light*, p. 150

**Separation**
Sorting the pure from impure. A sword divides light from dark. Eagle rises, toad sinks. Discernment—keeping what serves, releasing what doesn't.
> "Fire separates everything that is joined, and that which is of its own nature it optimally purifies." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light*, p. 150

**Conjunction**
The sacred marriage. King and Queen embrace. Sun and moon merge into one. Opposites unite in the vessel. Integration of masculine and feminine within.
> "Remember to observe the triple secret of composition... otherwise the animated spirit cannot be joined to the body." —Khunrath, *Amphitheater*, p. 306

**Fermentation**
New life from decay. The peacock's tail appears—iridescent colors shimmer. Rotting matter births new growth. Inspiration arising from crisis.
> "Nature gives motion, motion excites air, air excites fire, and fire separates, purifies, digests, colors." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light*, p. 150

**Distillation**
Extracting essence. Vapors rise through the alembic, condense, fall, rise again. Repeated refinement. Purifying understanding through cycles of reflection.
> "The tincture represents the Soul, the spirit of wine represents the Body: nor can they ever be separated." —Drebbel, *Two Treatises* (1628), p. 58

**Coagulation**
Spirit becomes matter. The distilled essence crystallizes into solid form. The Philosopher's Stone manifests. Grounding insight into reality.
> "Dissolve your metal... let it slowly coagulate in a warm place." —Drebbel, *Two Treatises*, p. 59

---

## Elements

**Fire**
The transforming principle. Roaring flames, the salamander dancing within. Upward-pointing triangle. Will, action, purification. What burns away the false.
> "Fire acts in wonderful hidden ways upon other Elements and upon all things." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light*, p. 150

**Water**
The dissolving principle. Flowing streams, the undine spirit. Downward-pointing triangle. Emotion, intuition, the unconscious depths. What receives and dissolves.
> "Water washes and purifies all imperfect things." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light*, p. 150

**Air**
The communicating principle. Swirling winds, sylphs in flight. Triangle with line. Thought, breath, intellect. The medium between fire and water.
> "Motion excites air, air excites fire." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light*, p. 150

**Earth**
The grounding principle. Mountains, caves, crystals growing in darkness. Inverted triangle with line. Body, stability, manifestation. What receives the tincture.
> "Earth receives the Tincture." —Sendivogius, *New Chemical Light*, p. 150

**Quintessence**
The fifth element. Starry cosmos, spiraling galaxy, celestial light beyond the four. The eternal, unchanging essence. Spirit that animates all matter.
> "The Quintessence is an eternal, immutable, incombustible thing, like the invincible heaven." —Drebbel, *Two Treatises*, p. 45

---

## Principles

**Sulphur** (Soul)
The combustible principle. Burning sun, golden flames, the solar king. What gives life and desire. The masculine, active, animating force within all things.
> "Fire, Sulphur; Salt, Balsam; Mercury—the three called Prima Materia, having only one name." —Paracelsus, *Book of Meteors* (1566), p. 14

**Mercury** (Spirit)
The volatile principle. Winged messenger, caduceus staff, quicksilver flowing. What moves between states. The hermaphroditic mediator, ever-changing.
> "From living quicksilver comes the prima materia: the proximate universal matter." —*Rosicrucian MS* (17th c.), p. 85

**Salt** (Body)
The fixed principle. White crystals, the cubic stone, what remains after fire. The feminine, receptive, stable form. The body that contains spirit.

**Crucible**
The testing vessel. A ceramic pot glowing red in fierce flame. Matter is tested, proved, transformed. Trial by fire reveals true nature.

**Retort**
The vessel of return. A bent-neck flask that sends condensed vapors back to the body. The pelican feeding its young. Circulation, returning to source.
